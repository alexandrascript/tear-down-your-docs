# How to tear down your documentation
## (And rewrite docs that actually work)

In this repository, you will find my presentation for [Write The Docs Prague 2018](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2018/). This includes a PDF version of the slides, Keynote, Microsoft PowerPoint, and visual assets.

## Talk abstract

We all know what it’s like to look at a series of existing documentation and think, “how did this happen?” Be it a large swath of unorganized content or a lack of a clear strategy, the complications of bad docs aren’t just a curse for documentation editors. Our readers see it, too. It leads to confused support requests and possibly a loss of customers.

When I started at Joyent, I was continuously made aware of documentation that needed help, and it felt like a nonstop firefight. Over time, I was able to quell the fires, create a content strategy, and completely redefine how our documentation works. 

While in the middle of my overhaul, my work was blown up a second time and my project was put on hold. From these challenges, I’ve learned it’s all about being organized and having a clear strategy.

In this talk, we’ll discuss:

   + how to get buy‐in for a documentation do‐over
   + how to pivot from rewriting docs to starting from scratch
   + content strategy (and how to write a great one)
   + empathy for our readers
   + setting easy‐to‐follow guidelines for non‐professional writers

We’ll also touch on how to prioritize and manage all of this work without additional full‐time documentation help.

### Real talk abstract

The big divergence is that I'm going to spend most of the time talking about how to write a proposal to convince your manager to let you tear down your docs. Useful stuff, I hope.

## Who am I?

My name is Alexandra White, and I'm a technical writer (and soon-to-be curriculum creator) for [Joyent](https://www.joyent.com/). Prior to that, I was a web developer for a U.S. television station, WNET. Throughout my career I've been an advocate for code comments, useful READMEs, and reusable documentation.

+ [See my work](https://heyawhite.com/). It's mostly web development projects, but there's also some writing.
+ [Let's be Twitter friends](https://twitter.com/heyawhite). People should be nicer on Twitter. We can be those people.
